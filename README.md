# DecisionTree

I implemented the decision tree machine learning algorithm, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3). The tree is created using a training set of data, displays the tree, then tests the accuracy of the tree with the testing set of data. For example, the decision tree classified whethere mushrooms are poisonous given features of the plant and location of a patientâ€™s tumor given a series of medical observations.
